Lu, Y., Chen, Q., & Poon, S. (2021). A Robust and Accurate Approach to Detect Process Drifts from Event Streams. arXiv preprint [arXiv:2103.10749](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10749).

Our program uses some of the libraries in the "ProDrift2.5" package (https://apromore.org/platform/tools/).

The source code of our implementation is in the "Implementation" folder. You need to make external reference to the "ProDrift2.5" package to compile the code.

You can download the full package (including all excutable files and evaluation data) of our implementation at:


The synthetic data can also be downloaded seprately at:
